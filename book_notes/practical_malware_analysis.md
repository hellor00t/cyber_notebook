1. Upload the files to [http://www.VirusTotal.com/](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?

   Yes

2. When were these files compiled?

   ```text
    PEView - PE HEADER Creation Date
    Lab01-01.dll - 2010-12-19 16:16:38
    Lab01-01.exe - 2010-12-19 16:16:19
   ```

3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?

    Lab01-01.exe - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 DLL
   ```

4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?

   ```text
    Dependency Walker
    Lab01-01.dll: 
        * KERNEL32.DLL
        * WS2_32.DLL - A program that accesses either of these most likely connects to a network or performs network-related tasks.
            * closesocket
            * connect
            * inet_addr
            * recv
            * send
            * shutdown
            * socket
        * MSVCRT.DLL
    Lab01-01.exe:
        * KERNEL32.DLL - This is a very common DLL that contains core functionality, such as access and manipulation of memory, files, and hardware.
            * MapViewOfFile - Maps a file into memory and makes the contents of the file accessible via memory addresses. Launchers, loaders, and injectors use this function to read and modify PE files. By using MapViewOfFile, the malware can avoid using WriteFile to modify the contents of a file.

        * MSVCRT.DLL - rovides programs compiled by these versions of MSVC with most of the standard C library functions. These include string manipulation, memory allocation, C-style input/output calls, and others.
   ```

5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?

   ```text
    Strings
    Lab01-01.dll - 127.26.152.13
    Lab01-01.exe - C:\windows\System32\Kerne132.dll
   ```

6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?

   ```text
    Strings
    Lab01-01.dll - 127.26.152.13
    Lab01-01.exe
   ```

7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

   ```text
    Lab01-01.dll - 
    Lab01-01.exe -
